            Big Mountain Barbell started in 2014 as a small warehouse gym filled
            with a couple of squat racks, used barbells, an old treadmill, and a
            vision to create a positive, productive training environment for
            humans from all ages, backgrounds and skill levels.
          </p>
          <p>
            By 2017 growth had surpassed initial expectations, and our owners,
            Zac and Lynndsey, knew it was time to grow. In June of 2017, we
            moved into our Big Mountain Barbell 2.0 facility in Midvale, which
            boasts 11,000 square feet of gym space outfitted with only the best
            equipment.
          </p>

            We offer 24/7 access Gym Memberships while maintaining a tight-knit
            community with emphasis on positive vibes.
